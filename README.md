## Overview
Exploring City Bike data from New York to see if there are any general patterns that support adding City Bikes to Iowa. Using Tableua for data visualizations and Python for some data manipulation.

## Results

The first page of the story shows filterable line-graphs that show how long the bikes were checked out. The top graph is for all users (subscribers or not) with a filter for the how long (in hours) the bike was checked out. As you can see, the almost all rides are under an hour, with over half lasting under 30 minutes. The bottom graph splits the graph above by gender, and has two filters: 1- length of trip (in hours), and 2- gender. This shows that most of the users are male.

The second page shows a heatmap of the time of day the bikes are used. Monday through Friday display a similar pattern of high usage around commute hours (6am-9am, and 4pm-7pm). Saturday and Sunday are used most often between 9am and 7pm with a fairly even distribution of those times. Page three is also a heatmap but adds a breakdown for gender that can be filtered. Unknown has very few rides but they are mostly on the weekends. Male and Female follow the same patterns individualy that the heatmap for all people, but again, more males appear to be using the bikes.

Page four has a heatmap breaking down each user type (subscriber vs customer) by the gender and day of trip. The darkest colors are found in the subscriber section, with males riding more bikes than females and unknown. There are very few Unknown gender subscribers compared to Unknown gender customers. Male and Female follow the opposite pattern with more subscribers than customers.

The last two pages are heat maps of the starting location and ending location of the rides respectively. The first shows the starting points with darker and bigger circles corresponding to the number of such rides. The majority of the rides are loacted in Manhattan and are quite likely related to tourism. The second heat map with the ending location shows a nearly-identical image as the first.
